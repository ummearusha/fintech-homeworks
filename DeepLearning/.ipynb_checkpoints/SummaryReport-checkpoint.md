# Which model has a lower loss?					
										
The closing price model loss ranges from 0.03 to 0.55 where fng based model ranges between 0.06 and 0.72. This shows that the closing price model has lower loss.

# Which model tracks the actual values better over time?								
if compare the prediction vs real values in the charts, the closing price model tracks better against actual vs the fng model.										
# Which window size works best for the model?	

After predicting  closing prices using a 10 day window of previous fng values and experimenting with window sizes  from 1 to 10 I see the model performance varies and found window size 10 day works best for the model.
