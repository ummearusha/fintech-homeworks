Write a short description about what the wallet does, what is is built with, and how to use it.

In this H/W I created a wallet python file which derived the function for multiple coins ETH and BTC to send the transaction to different users addresses.
I created another two functions - create transcation and  send transaction for teh main purpose of this homework.
create transcation is the raw, unsigned transaction that contains all metadata needed to transact.
send trasaction call create transaction, sign the transaction, then send it to the designated network.



Include installing pip dependencies using requirements.txt, as well as cloning and installing hd-wallet-derive.
You may include the hd-wallet-derive folder in your repo, but still include the install instructions. You do not
need to include Python or PHP installation instructions.

attached screenshots for all dependencies insatllation i did for this homework.
