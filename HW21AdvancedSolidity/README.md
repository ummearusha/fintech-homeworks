 the process for purchasing PupperCoin 
 
 - First deployed three contracts simultaneously

contract PupperCoinSaleDeployer
 contract PupperCoinSale
 contract Puppercoin

- Secondly

I tried to add 300 token which is the goal into the account which is doing crowdsaling but misatkenly it was not properly input and shows 0 PUPC
 To buy token I had to import the account from the ganache first and copy it to the buy token function and select transact to confirm that i am getting token from that account
 in this way i could choose three different address form the ganache but balanceof function is not showing proper balance.
 
 I just completed upto this and also finalize function but still balance of not showing proper amount.
 
please provide screenshots 

- There are four screenshots provided what I have done for testing



Include information such as the token parameters, token name, crowdsale cap, etc.

token name : PupperCoin
Token Symbol - PUPC
