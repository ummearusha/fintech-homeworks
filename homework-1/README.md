## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Digital currency is a powerful technology, but the benefits of it will not be accessible to people unless we make it easy to use. Coinbase excels at making great products that bring the benefits of digital currency to everyone.
An open financial system is one that is not controlled by any one country or company (just like the internet did for distributing information). We think this is the highest leverage way to bring about more economic freedom, innovation, efficiency, and equality of opportunity in the world. Coinbase  has a ten year plan to get there.
Imagine if every payment in the world was as fast, cheap, and global as sending an email.
Imagine if anyone who had an idea for a product could have customers all over the world from day one.
Imagine if anyone with a smartphone had access to the same financial services we enjoy in the developed world.
An open financial system can be a great equalizer and lift billions out of poverty while accelerating the pace of innovation around the world. This is the best way Coinbase know to change the world.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Coinbase Wallet now allows users to register and store “crypto” domains, featuring payments through domain handles instead of cryptographic addresses.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Coinbase expects this surge in funding and innovation to continue as blockchain and FinTech move from a largely retail focus to include more institutional use. And while many of the companies may not survive the next three to five years, Coinbase believes the use of the blockchain “public ledger” will go on to become an integral part of financial institutions’ technology and operational infrastructure.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Coinbase is the most popular consumer-facing crypto asset exchange in the United States. Operating since 2011, the company allows users to buy, sell, and store crypto assets, like bitcoin and ethereum.
The company already has significant visibility with consumers in a sector that was once exclusively the province of crypto asset enthusiasts. In mid-December, the company’s mobile app reached the top spot on Apple’s App Store.
Coinbase has soared in popularity and turned itself into the on-ramp for mainstream crypto investors by positioning itself as a safe harbor among crypto asset exchanges. The company has never been hacked, unlike many of its competitors. Coinbase has also maniacally pursued compliance with existing regulations and law enforcement, putting it on the right side of the law — another huge asset in a sector that is still in desperate need of regulatory guidance.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The core metric, to help crypto grow beyond just trading and speculation. It's like the early days of the internet where people were trading domain names, hoping they might be useful for something in the future. Well it's time to make those things useful!


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Coinbase thus finds itself caught between worlds: it’s the most well-funded blockchain company in the United States, but it’s a centralized company, not a decentralized ledger. The company once advertised crypto assets as the “future of money,” but now positions itself as a way to “buy and sell digital currency.” In many ways, Coinbase is a centralized on-ramp to a decentralized ecosystem.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

My recommendation would be Coinbase builds bitcoin based  POS (point of sale )  products that can sale their service to the street marchant ( eg. Mom and Pop shop, big retail stores)  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

There is a very good chance that use of cryptocurrency will grow significantly during the next few years. If they can build cryptocurrency based POS  and have the concept or the product validate in the market today, it will give them an early mover of advantage.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Coinbase will need to be build a app that customers can use to make payments.The app can be build for iphone (IOS) and android (java based) .This app will have to communicate in a secure manner to servers (hosting web services using python and cryptocurrency technologies)
